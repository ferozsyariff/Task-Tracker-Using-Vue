# vue-crash-2022

## Overview

This project is to be run locally for now

There are two parts to this project:
(1) the frontend, built using Vue - port that it runs on depends on your machine (usually `8080`, or `8081`)
(2) a mock backend, built using Json-Server - run on `port 5000` by default

## Project setup

If you are using this project, you may choose to delete all data in the `tasks` array in `db.json` (the mock backend). It is currently populated with dummy data

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

### Appreciation

Major appreciation to [Brad Travery](https://github.com/bradtraversy) for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs&t=3282s) tutorial on how to build this. A real legend for us beginners.
